These data and codes implement part of the analysis conducted in the paper

Samad, I., Sutaria, D. & Shanker, K. (in press). Species rich but data poor: leveraging distribution modelling techniques to map cetacean occurrence in South Asian waters. Biodiversity and Conservation.

The code is structured in three parts which include
a) Tuning each model to obtain optimal hyperparameters for the data
b) Run each model and generate predictions (including ensembles) while obtaining model evaluation metrics and thresholds
c) Generate evaluation metrics for ensemble models and CBI metrics for all models.

Note that different parameters of the setup e.g., buffer distance, thinning radius can be changed for estimating changes in model performance.
